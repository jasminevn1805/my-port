										<h1>How I tackled and designed Patient Onboarding to boost engagement and minimize friction in Asynchronous Dermatology app</h1>
										<p><b>Project Name:</b> Dermago - Personalized Patient Onboarding Flow<br/>
										<b>Industry:</b> Healthcare, Dermatology<br/>

									<blockquote>In this case study, I designed a patient onboarding flow for an asynchronous dermatology application to boost user engagement. The onboarding process allows patients to select consultation types (for themselves, their child, or someone in their care) and provides personalized treatment plans through a preference questionnaire. I addressed challenges such as allowing users to explore the app without sign-in interruptions and simplifying follow-up consultations by preloading prior medical data. Additionally, I implemented an educational walkthrough to guide users through the app's key features. These improvements enhanced user satisfaction, increased engagement, and streamlined the consultation process.</blockquote>

									<!-- About the App -->
									<h3>About the App</h3>
									<p>Dermago is an asynchronous dermatology application that allows patients to consult with dermatologists by submitting images and descriptions of their skin conditions for review. The platform is designed to make dermatological care more accessible and flexible, as users do not need to schedule live appointments.</p>

									<!-- Why Onboarding Matters -->
									<h3>Why Onboarding Matters</h3>
									<p>Onboarding is the first point of interaction between users and the app. It not only sets the tone but also determines how likely users are to engage with core features such as submitting a case for booking a consultation, and exploring treatment options. For an application in healthcare, onboarding needs to provide clarity, instill trust, and lead patients seamlessly into their care journey.</p>
									<p>The challenge was to design an onboarding experience that not only welcomed users but also:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Engage new users</b> and guide them seamlessly through the decision-making process of submitting a consultation case.</li>
										<li><b>Educate patients</b> on how to use the app’s unique asynchronous consultation model.</li>
										<li><b>Increased engagement</b> by ensuring that users felt confident in completing the onboarding process and were guided to take immediate action, such as submitting their first consultation.</li>
										<li><b>Build trust</b> and ensure that users understand the app’s value, security, and privacy measures.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I knew that if the onboarding was too complex or unclear, users might not fully understand how the app works, and this could lead to abandonment before they even start their first consultation.</p>

									<!-- Objectives -->
									<h3>Objectives</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>To design an intuitive and engaging onboarding flow for new patients.</li>
										<li>Allow users to do consultation for demands (for themselve, child, or a person in their care).</li>
										<li>Receive customized treatment suggestions based on their preferences (treatment method, expected response time).</li>
									</ol>


									<!-- Research -->
									<h3>Research</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>Assumption</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Before diving into the design, I looked up some insight about potential user behaviors and expectations on telehealth platform on some aspects:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>User Behavior in Digital Healthcare</b><br> Patients often prefer minimal interaction in health app, especially during the initial stages. They want fast access to healthcare without being overwhelmed with lengthy forms or unfamiliar workflows.</li><br>
												<li><b>Complexity of Dermatological Care</b><br> Dermatology assessments require high-quality images and detailed information about symptoms. However, asking for too much information upfront can frustrate users who might not yet understand why it is necessary.</li><br>
												<li><b>Engagement Patterns</b><br> Users in healthcare apps often abandon the flow when faced with complex procedures. If onboarding is not designed to be quick and relevant, users are less likely to engage with the app’s core functions, such as submitting their first consultation request.</li><br>
												<li><b>Personalization Trends</b><br> Personalization has proven to be a key factor in increasing user satisfaction and engagement, especially in healthcare. Allowing users to specify their preferences early on leads to better outcomes and more relevant treatment plans. </li><br>
												<li><b>Asynchronous Care Research</b><br> I reviewed literature and case studies about synchronous healthcare models, learning that clear communication and patient education during onboarding were critical to success.</li><br>
											</ul>
										</dd>
										<dt>User research</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>To verify my assumption, I carried out comprehensive research using various methods:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Competitive Analysis</b><br> I examined other healthcare and dermatology apps to identify best practices and gaps in onboarding flows. Many apps overwhelmed users by asking for too much information upfront, leading drop-offs. Others failed to explain their unique features clearly.</li><br>
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
													<figcaption>Fig.1 - Image 11</figcaption>
												</span>
												<li><b>User interviews</b><br> I interviewed 10 potential users to understand their pain points when accessing digital healthcare or dermatology services and their expectations from a healthcare app. The key findings were:
													<ul>
														<li>Users valued ease of use and wanted a clear understanding of the steps required for dermatological consultation</li>
														<li>Privacy and data security were major concerns.</li>
													</ul>
												</li>

									<!-- Personas -->
									<h3>User Personas</h3>
									<p>I developed three primary personas:</p>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Anna</b> - A 34-year-old mother booking consultation for her child.</li>
										<li><b>David</b> - A 28-year-old tech professional who values quick, efficient dermatological care for himself.</li>
										<li><b>Sarah</b> - A 42-year-old caregiver seeking consultation for her elderly mother.</li>
									</ol>

									<!-- Challenges and Solutions -->
									<h3>Design Challenges and Solutions</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>Challenge 1: Multiple Consultation Types</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>Users needed to choose whether the consultation was for themselves, their child, or someone in their care. The app had to handle these different scenarios smoothly without confusing users.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I designed a <b>decision-making interface</b> early in the onboarding process where users could easily select the type of consultation they needed. Each option was accompanied by clear, concise descriptions and visual cues (icons and short text) to ensure that users could make an informed choice.</p>
											<p>The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</figcaption>
											</span>
										</dd>
										<dt>Challenge 2: Allow users go through onboarding without Sign-In Interruption</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>Many users become frustrated when healthcare apps force them to sign in or create an account before they can explore the app, or understand its value. This often leads to drop-offs during the onboarding process.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I designed the onboarding flow to <b>defer sign-in until the end of the process</b>. Users could go through the consultation selection, answer medical questionnaire and treatment preference, and get a feel for the app’s functionality <b>before being prompted to sign in or create an account</b>.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Delaying the sign-in request until the user was ready to submit their first consultation helps reduce friction and allowe users to engage with the app more freely. This approach built trust and helped users understand the app’s value before committing to registration.</figcaption>

										</dd>
										<dt>Challenge 3: Easy on Follow-Up consultations</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>During follow-up consultations, it must be frustrating to input the same medical information and details they had already submitted during the initial consultation. This redundancy adds unnecessary friction, wastes time, and can lower user satisfaction, especially in an asynchronous application where efficiency and convenience are key.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I designed the follow-up flow to <b>automatically preload relevant medical data</b> from the patient’s first consultation. This included information such as Medical History, Skin Condition Details, Treatment Preferences. This allows them to <b>confirm or update</b> any details as needed, as well as <b>skip unnecessary data entry</b>.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - The preloaded data feature not only streamlined the follow-up process but also contributed to an overall sense of continuity in care, allowing patients to feel that their medical journey was being manage seamlessly and with minimal effort on their part.</figcaption>

										</dd>
										<dt>Challenge 4: Educate users about what's the app offers and reduce cognitive load</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>Users who are unfamiliar with asynchronous heal care apps often feel uncertain about the app’s full capabilities. Without proper guidance or an introduction to key features, user may feel overwhelmed or miss out on valuable services, leading to lower engagement and even abandonment.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>To address this, I designed a <b>guided walkthrough</b> that introduces new users to the app’s core features during the onboarding process. This walkthrough aimed to <b>educate users upfront</b> about what the app offers before they began exploring it independently. The walkthrough included a <b>brief, straight toward overview</b> of the app’s main services, such as how to submit skin consultation, receive expert advice, and manage follow-up consultations. By simplifying the explanation with visual and description, I reduced confusion and built confidence in the process.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Breaking the onboarding into manageable steps, users feel less overwhelmed and are more likely to complete the process.</figcaption>
											</span>
										</dd>
										<dt>Challenge 5: Making the process user friendly</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>Digital healthcare onboarding require detailed medical information, but asking for too much detail upfront can overwhelm users.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I implemented a <b>progressive onboarding</b> approach. The onboarding was broken down into small steps. Keep steps simple and only collect essential information upfront to avoid overwhelming users.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Step 1: Select the consultation type (self, child, s.o. in care), new or follow-up consultation</li>
												<li>Step 2: Patient personal information</li>
												<li>Step 3: Skin condition describe</li>
												<li>Step 4: Medical history + Personalized questionnaire of treatment preferences</li>
												<li>Step 5: Review</li>
												<li>Step 6: Deferred Sign-In</li>
												<li>Step 7: Do payment and submit consultation</li>
												<li>Confirmation and Onboarding complete Screen</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Regarding visual design:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Progress bar: indicated at the top of the screen shows users how far along they are in the process, which reduces frustration.</li>
												<li>Next/Back options: allow users to go next/get the previous steps as needed.</li>
												<li>Microcopy: use friendly, supportive language throughout the process to keep users engaged and help them understand the app’s value.</li>
											</ul>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Breaking the onboarding into manageable steps, users feel less overwhelmed and are more likely to complete the process.</figcaption>
