										<h1>How I tackled and designed Patient Onboarding to boost engagement and minimize friction in Asynchronous Dermatology app</h1>
										<p><b>Project Name:</b> Dermago - Personalized Patient Onboarding Flow<br/>
										<b>Industry:</b> Healthcare, Dermatology<br/>
										<b>Platform:</b> Mobile and Web<br/>
										<b>Role:</b> UX Designer<br/>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<blockquote>In this case study, I designed a patient onboarding flow for an asynchronous dermatology application to boost user engagement. The onboarding process allows patients to select consultation types (for themselves, their child, or someone in their care) and provides personalized treatment plans through a preference questionnaire. I addressed challenges such as allowing users to explore the app without sign-in interruptions and simplifying follow-up consultations by preloading prior medical data. Additionally, I implemented an educational walkthrough to guide users through the app's key features. These improvements enhanced user satisfaction, increased engagement, and streamlined the consultation process.</blockquote>

									<!-- About the App -->
									<h3>Context</h3>
									<p>Dermago is an asynchronous dermatology application that allows patients to consult with dermatologists by submitting images and descriptions of their skin conditions for review. Onboarding is the first point of interaction between users and the app. Introducing core features, driving user activation, and maximizing retention rates after the user onboarding experience will all impact the user journey moving forward.</p>

									<!-- Why Onboarding Matters -->
									<h3>Phase 0: Discovery project</h3>
									<p>At first, I drove the initial UX research, including competitive analysis, and analysis of the target audience's needs and pains. Insight from this research became a backbone for all future improvements.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Engage new users</b> and guide them seamlessly through the decision-making process of submitting a consultation case.</li>
										<li><b>Educate patients</b> on how to use the app’s unique asynchronous consultation model.</li>
										<li><b>Increased engagement</b> by ensuring that users felt confident in completing the onboarding process and were guided to take immediate action, such as submitting their first consultation.</li>
										<li><b>Build trust</b> and ensure that users understand the app’s value, security, and privacy measures.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I knew that if the onboarding was too complex or unclear, users might not fully understand how the app works, and this could lead to abandonment before they even start their first consultation.</p>

									<!-- Objectives -->
									<h3>Objectives</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>To design an intuitive and engaging onboarding flow for new patients.</li>
										<li>Allow users to do consultation for demands (for themselve, child, or a person in their care).</li>
										<li>Receive customized treatment suggestions based on their preferences (treatment method, expected response time).</li>
									</ol>


									<!-- Research -->
									<h1>Phase 0: Discovery project</h1>
									<p>First, I looked up some insight about potential user behaviors and expectations on telehealth platform which led to some assumptions. Next, to verify it, I carried out the concept user research using user survey, then confident to build the user personas for the product.</p>
									<dl>
										<dt>Industry research</dt>
										<dd>
											<ul>
												<li><b>User Behavior in Digital Healthcare</b><br> Patients often prefer minimal interaction in health app, especially during the initial stages.</li>
												<li><b>Complexity of Dermatological Care</b><br> Asking for too much information upfront can frustrate users who might not yet understand why it is necessary.</li>
												<li><b>Engagement Patterns</b><br> If onboarding is not designed to be quick and relevant, users are less likely to engage with the app’s core functions, such as submitting their first consultation request.</li>
												<li><b>Personalization Trends</b><br> Personalization has proven to be a key factor in increasing user satisfaction and engagement, especially in healthcare.</li>
												<li><b>Asynchronous Care Research</b><br> Learning that clear communication and patient education during onboarding were critical to success.</li>

										<h3>Problem statement</h3>
										<blockquote>Patients using digital healthcare apps need a way to quickly access care with minimal friction because lengthy forms and complex workflows can lead to frustration and drop-offs, reducing engagement with essential features like submitting a consultation request.</blockquote>

									<!-- Challenges and Solutions -->
									<h1>Phase 1: Ideation</h1>
									
									<dl>
										<h3>How Might We</h3>
										<blockquote>How might we make the onboarding process seamless and intuitive to reduce friction for first-time users so they will engage with the app deeper and longer?</blockquote>
										

										<dt>Brainstorm using card sorting</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>To ensure an intuitive and engaging onboarding experience, I began by mapping out the user journey through a user story and user flow diagram. This approach helped translate insights into actionable solutions and provided a clear, understandable document for discussion with stakeholders.</p>

											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/onboarding-validatedesignconcept.png" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - User onboarding flow</figcaption></span>
										</dd>

										<p>Based on the instructive opinion from the ideation session with the team, I defined a roadmap of UX improvements including:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>New walthrough screens</li>
											<li>Make the consultation types more standout</li>
											<li>Move sign-up step toward the end of the process</li>
											<li>Keep design flexible for feature added later on: Follow-up Consultation</li>
										</ul>
										
									</dl>
									<hr/>


									<h1>Phase 2: Design, Test, and Iteration</h1>
									<dl>
										<dt>Design challenge 1 - Educate users about what's the app offers to reduce cognitive load</dt>
										
										<dd>
											<blockquote>Users who are unfamiliar with asynchronous heal care apps often feel uncertain about the app’s full capabilities. Without proper guidance or an introduction to key features, user may feel overwhelmed or miss out on valuable services, leading to lower engagement and even abandonment.</blockquote>
											
											<p>To address this, I designed a <b>guided walkthrough</b> that introduces new users to the app’s core features during the onboarding process. This walkthrough aimed to <b>educate users upfront</b> about what the app offers before they began exploring it independently. The walkthrough included a <b>brief, straight toward overview</b> of the app’s main services, such as how to submit skin consultation, receive expert advice, and manage follow-up consultations. By simplifying the explanation with visual and description, I reduced confusion and built confidence in the process.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/onboading-walkthrough.png" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Breaking the onboarding into manageable steps, users feel less overwhelmed and are more likely to complete the process.</figcaption>
											</span>
										</dd>

										<dt>Design challenge 2 - Allow user select the appropriate Consultation Type</dt>
										<dd>
											<blockquote>Users needed to choose whether the consultation was for themselves, their child, or someone in their care. The app had to handle these different scenarios smoothly without confusing users.</blockquote>
											<p>I designed a <b>decision-making interface</b> early in the onboarding process where users could easily select the type of consultation they needed. Each option was accompanied by clear, concise descriptions and visual cues (icons and short text) to ensure that users could make an informed choice.</p>
											<p>The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/onboading-step1and2.png" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</figcaption>
											</span>
										</dd>
										<dt>Challenge 2: Allow users go through onboarding without Sign-In Interruption</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>Many users become frustrated when healthcare apps force them to sign in or create an account before they can explore the app, or understand its value. This often leads to drop-offs during the onboarding process.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I designed the onboarding flow to <b>defer sign-in until the end of the process</b>. Users could go through the consultation selection, answer medical questionnaire and treatment preference, and get a feel for the app’s functionality <b>before being prompted to sign in or create an account</b>.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Delaying the sign-in request until the user was ready to submit their first consultation helps reduce friction and allowe users to engage with the app more freely. This approach built trust and helped users understand the app’s value before committing to registration.</figcaption>

										</dd>
										<dt>Challenge 3: Easy on Follow-Up consultations</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>During follow-up consultations, it must be frustrating to input the same medical information and details they had already submitted during the initial consultation. This redundancy adds unnecessary friction, wastes time, and can lower user satisfaction, especially in an asynchronous application where efficiency and convenience are key.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I designed the follow-up flow to <b>automatically preload relevant medical data</b> from the patient’s first consultation. This included information such as Medical History, Skin Condition Details, Treatment Preferences. This allows them to <b>confirm or update</b> any details as needed, as well as <b>skip unnecessary data entry</b>.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - The preloaded data feature not only streamlined the follow-up process but also contributed to an overall sense of continuity in care, allowing patients to feel that their medical journey was being manage seamlessly and with minimal effort on their part.</figcaption>

										</dd>
										
										<dt>Challenge 5: Making the process user friendly</dt>
										<dd>
											<h5>Problem</h5>
											<p>Digital healthcare onboarding require detailed medical information, but asking for too much detail upfront can overwhelm users.</p>
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>I implemented a <b>progressive onboarding</b> approach. The onboarding was broken down into small steps. Keep steps simple and only collect essential information upfront to avoid overwhelming users.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Step 1: Select the consultation type (self, child, s.o. in care), new or follow-up consultation</li>
												<li>Step 2: Patient personal information</li>
												<li>Step 3: Skin condition describe</li>
												<li>Step 4: Medical history + Personalized questionnaire of treatment preferences</li>
												<li>Step 5: Review</li>
												<li>Step 6: Deferred Sign-In</li>
												<li>Step 7: Do payment and submit consultation</li>
												<li>Confirmation and Onboarding complete Screen</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Regarding visual design:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Progress bar: indicated at the top of the screen shows users how far along they are in the process, which reduces frustration.</li>
												<li>Next/Back options: allow users to go next/get the previous steps as needed.</li>
												<li>Microcopy: use friendly, supportive language throughout the process to keep users engaged and help them understand the app’s value.</li>
											</ul>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" />
												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Breaking the onboarding into manageable steps, users feel less overwhelmed and are more likely to complete the process.</figcaption>

									<!-- User Testing -->
									<h3>User Testing</h3>
									<p>Dermago is an asynchronous dermatology application that allows patients to consult with dermatologists by submitting images and descriptions of their skin conditions for review. The platform is designed to make dermatological care more accessible and flexible, as users do not need to schedule live appointments.</p>
									<h5>Results</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Completion Rate: 90% of users who started onboarding completed the entire process, with minimal drop-off.</li>
										<li>User Engagement: 60% of users who completed onboarding submitted their first consultation immediately.</li>
										<li>Positive Feedback: Post-onboarding surveys indicated a 90% satisfaction rate, with users particularly appreciating the ease of using the app.</li>
										<li>Retention Tendency: Users who completed their first consultation during onboarding were more likely to the follow-ups, or engage with the app again.</li>
									</ul>
