												I believe great design happens when we ask the right questions, challenge assumptions, and stay relentlessly curious. My process focuses on understanding users, aligning with business goals, and creating elegant, usable solutions that scale with intention. <br><br>
												Outside of work, I find motivation in books, long hikes in nature, and meaningful relationships â€” all of which help me stay grounded, observant, and connected to what truly matters.</p>

										<h2>About</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Having invovled in digital design for over 5 years, I find great satisfaction from collaborating with stakeholders throughout the product development cycle. With a dedicated focus on user-centered design, design systems, and seamless design handoff processes, my objective is to streamline workflows, create user-friendly products, and deliver value to both end-users and businesses.</p>

									<p>Hello there, thanks for visiting my page! ðŸ˜Š<br> My name's Jasmine. Iâ€™m a product designer who believes that the most powerful designs are the simplest ones. Thoughtful, minimalist, and quietly effectiveâ€”my work is grounded in clarity and usefulness, yet shaped by an obsessive attention to detail. I love crafting experiences that not only function well but feel naturally intuitive, elevating digital products through restraint and intention. <br><br>
									Off the screen, I build furniture and wooden creations by handâ€”a practice that mirrors my design mindset: systematic, problem-solving, and hands-on creative. Each project, whether digital or physical, is an opportunity to reduce noise and surface what truly matters. <br><br>
									I find balance in nature. Whether Iâ€™m hiking mountain trails, camping under the stars, beside the fireside, or simply living close to the land, these moments outdoors help me reset, reflect, and return to design with fresh focus.</p>
