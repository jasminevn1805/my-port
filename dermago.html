										<h1>Phase 2. Design</h1>
										<div>
											<h2>Patient onboarding flow</h2><br>
										
											<h4>Design challenge 1 - Educate users about what's the app offers to reduce cognitive load</h4><br>
											<div>
												<p><b>Problem</b><br>Users who are unfamiliar with asynchronous healthcare apps often feel uncertain about the app’s full capabilities. Without proper guidance or an introduction to key features, user may feel overwhelmed or miss out on valuable services, leading to lower engagement and even abandonment.</p>
												
												<p><b>Solution</b><br>To address this, I designed a <b>guided walkthrough</b> that introduces new users to the app’s core features during the onboarding process. This walkthrough aimed to <b>educate users upfront</b> about what the app offers before they began exploring it independently. The walkthrough included a <b>brief, straight toward overview</b> of the app’s main services, such as how to submit skin consultation, receive expert advice, and manage follow-up consultations. By simplifying the explanation with visual and description, I reduced confusion and built confidence in the process.</p>
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/onboading-walkthrough.png" alt="walkthrough" />
													<figcaption>12 / 24 - Guided walkthrough screens introduce the app's core features during the onboading process</figcaption>
												</span>
											</div>
											<br><br>

											<h4>Design challenge 2 - Allow user select the appropriate Consultation Type</h4><br>
											<div>
												<p><b>Problem</b><br>Users needed to choose whether the consultation was for themselves, their child, or someone in their care. The app had to handle these different scenarios smoothly without confusing users.</p>
												<p><b>Solution</b><br>I designed a <b>decision-making interface</b> early in the onboarding process where users could easily select the type of consultation they needed. Each option was accompanied by clear, concise descriptions and visual cues (icons and short text) to ensure that users could make an informed choice. The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</p>
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/onboading-step1and2.png" alt="onboading-step1and2" />
													<figcaption>13 / 24 - The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</figcaption>
												</span>
											</div>
											<br><br>

											<h4>Design challenge 3 - Making the process user friendly</h4><br>
											<div>
												<p><b>Problem</b><br>Digital healthcare onboarding require detailed medical information, but asking for too much detail upfront can overwhelm users.</p>
												<p><b>Solution</b><br>Display essential information once at a time. Grouping them into relevant categories at each step to reduce users' cognitive load.</p>
												<!--<ul>
													<li>Step 1: Select the consultation type (self, child, s.o. in care), new or follow-up consultation</li>
													<li>Step 2: Patient personal information</li>
													<li>Step 3: Skin condition describe</li>
													<li>Step 4: Medical history + Personalized questionnaire of treatment preferences</li>
													<li>Step 5: Review</li>
													<li>Step 6: Deferred Sign-In</li>
													<li>Step 7: Do payment and submit consultation</li>
													<li>Confirmation and Onboarding complete Screen</li>
												</ul>
											
												<p>Regarding visual design:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Progress bar: indicated at the top of the screen shows users how far along they are in the process, which reduces frustration.</li>
													<li>Next/Back options: allow users to go next/get the previous steps as needed.</li>
													<li>Microcopy: use friendly, supportive language throughout the process to keep users engaged and help them understand the app’s value.</li>
												</ul>
												-->
												<span class="image fit"><img src="images/onboading-groupinginformation.png" alt="data-set" />
													<figcaption>14 / 24 - Breaking the onboarding into manageable steps, users feel less overwhelmed and are more likely to complete the process.</figcaption>
												</span>
											</div>
											<br><br>

											<h4>Design challenge 4 - Allow users go through onboarding without Sign-Up Interruption</h4><br>
											<div>
												<p><b>Problem</b><br>Many users become frustrated when healthcare apps force them to sign in or create an account before they can explore the app, or understand its value. This often leads to drop-offs during the onboarding process.</p>
												<p><b>Solution</b><br>I designed the onboarding flow to <b>defer sign-in until the end of the process</b>. Users could go through the consultation selection, answer medical questionnaire and treatment preference, and get a feel for the app’s functionality <b>before being prompted to sign in or create an account</b>. By delaying the sign-in request until the user was ready to submit their first consultation, it reduced friction and allowed users to engage with the app more freely. This approach built trust and helped users understand the app’s value before committing to registration.</p>

											<h2>Doctor working flow</h2>
											
												<h4>Design challenge 1 - Helping doctors manage consultation requests effectively</h4><br>
												<div>
													<p><b>Problem</b><br>Doctors were overwhelmed by the volume of consultation requests and wishes a structured way to quickly assess, sort, or prioritize them. The importance of an intuitive listing made it easier to track the progress systematically.</p>
													<p><b>Solution</b><br>I designed a <b>Consotation Grid View</b> - a centralized hub where all incoming and ongoing cases are presented at a glance. Each request item highlights essential information upfront like: Patient name & age, Time since submission, Case urgency, Type of issue, Status.<br>Plus, applying visual clue like icons to reduce the cognitive load. Also, doctors can filter, search, and sort to focus on priority cases.<br>This solution improved case triaging, and saved time navigating through patient queues.</p>

												<h4>Design challenge 2 - Enabling doctors to diagnose and provide treatments efficiently</h4><br>
												<div>
													<p><b>Problem</b><br>Providing diagnoses and treatment plans for common skin conditions is often a straightforward task—but it is also time-consuming and highly repetitive. By enabling doctors with a streamlined and efficient way to handle these cases, we can significantly reduce cognitive load and manual effort, increase productivity, and ultimately make their day-to-day workflow more manageable and satisfying.</p>
													<p><b>Solution</b><br>To address this, I designed a focused consultation workspace where doctors can efficiently process a case without context switching.</p>

												<h4>Design challenge 3 - Ensuring continuity of care in Follow-up Consultations for better long-term care</h4><br>
												<div>
													<p><b>Problem</b><br>Providing doctors with a streamlined way to manage follow-up consultations improves efficiency and continuity of care. Currently, doctors may need to revisit past records manually or rely on nurses to retrieve previous patient information—adding friction to the process. Without clear access to consultation history, important context may be lost, impacting the quality of care and consistency of treatment plans.</p>
													<p><b>Solution</b><br>I designed a Consultation History feature within each case, then doctors could use this historical insight to make more informed follow-up decisions and tailor future treatment plans based on observed progress.</p>

											Task assigned:
											<ol>
												<li>Start a new consultation, describe symptoms, and upload photos of the skin issue</li>
												<li>Select the treatment plan, complete payment, and submit the consultation request</li>
												<li>Send messages to the doctor</li>

										<br>

										<div>
											<p><b>Key findings and usability issues</b></p>
											
											<p>1) Overwhelming Input Forms → Drop-Off Risk<br>
											Long and dense input forms caused users to feel overwhelmed early in the process. Some users hesitated or skipped optional questions, expressing that the effort felt “too much” before even submitting the consultation. This friction increases the risk of abandonment.</p>

											<p>2) Poor Layout Clarity → Confusion and Navigation Struggles<br> A progress bar (top of screen on both mobile and desktop) contributed to visual clutter, making it harder for users to focus on the task. Additionally, the [Back] button placement—too far down the screen—was difficult to reach, especially on mobile, slowing task completion and increasing frustration.</p>

											<p><b>Proposed solution</b></p>
											<p>1) Simplify design layout to improve Visual Hierarchy and Readability <br>
											- Updated the color system to improved the contrast between text fields and background for better readability. <br>
											- Redesign the header section, particularly the progress indicator to help the layout got a minimal look.</p>

											<br><br>

											<p>2) Reduce Cognitive Load & Information Density by spliting content to multi-managable steps <br>
											- The forms contain a lot of input fields on a single screen. Breaking them down into smaller sections by adding more space in between might reduce overwhelm. <br>
											- Using progressive disclosure (showing additional fields only when relevant).</p>

											<p><b>Objectives</b><br>To identify usability issues that affect speed, clarity, and satisfaction for doctors on how:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Efficient consultation triage and management</li>
												<li>Fast and confident diagnosis & treatment workflows</li>
											</ul>

											<p><b>Methodology</b><br>
												Participants: 2 dermatologists <br>
												Method: Remote moderated test using a clickable prototype (Figma) <br>
												Task assigned:
												<ol>
													<li>View and prioritize consultation requests</li>
													<li>Diagnose a case and submit a treatment plan</li>
													<li>Handle a follow-up case (review history and provide updated care)</li>
												</ol>
											</p>

										<br>


										<div>
											<p><b>Key findings and usability issues</b></p>
												<p>1) Friction in Accessing Follow-Up Case History<br>During usability testing, both doctors experienced friction when trying to access prior information related to a follow-up consultation. The current flow separates the follow-up case from its previous instances. To retrieve past records, doctors had to: Open the current case -> Click into [View consultation history] -> Select and open the previous case's details. This multi-step process slowed them down.</p>
												<p>2) The consultation history was plit into two tabs - Follow-ups vs. Others - which caused confusion <br>Doctors were unsure why the same patient's consultation records were divided and had difficulty define the relevant information in the current context.</p>
												<p>3) Lack of Skin Progression context <br>Seeing only the current state skin photos was insufficient for understanding the treatment's effectiveness over time. Doctors wanted an overview of skin progression to assess whether the condition had improved, worsened, or remained unchanged.</p>
										</div>
										<br>

										<div>
											<p><b>Proposed solution</b></p>
											<p>1) Expanded grid view with parent/child items allows doctors to access related sub-items directly within the context of the larger list, without navigating away. This approach also reduces the need to separate consultation history into two tabs, helping to minimize unnecessary information and keep the context more focused.</p>
											<p>2) For follow-up usecase, add Skin Progression section to case's details, introduce a visual timeline and gallery of skin photos, showing all submissions in chronological order. </p>

									<h1>Outcomes</h1>
									<p>After implementing UX improvements based on initial user feedback, a second round of user testing was conducted with 5 users to validate the changes. Here are the key results:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Completion Rate Increased by 22% – Breaking long forms into smaller chunks and streamlining inputs reduced drop-offs.</li>
										<li>Higher user satisfaction – Clearer UI, improved navigation, and better form structure resulted in 85% positive feedback.</li>
										<li>Increased confidence in submission – The summary step and confirmation message reassured 90% of users.</li>
									</ul>

								<!-- Key Learnings -->
								<section id="learnings">
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h1>Key Learnings</h1>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Stakeholder Collaboration is Foundational</b><br> Working closely with stakeholders from the beginning was crucial. Early alignment through interviews and requirement gathering helped surface real workflow challenges and business expectations—ensuring the design stayed grounded, strategic, and relevant throughout the process.</li>
										<li><b>Design Thinking Brings Clarity to Complex Workflows</b><br> Applying a structured design thinking approach helped break down complex consultation workflows into actionable design challenges. By moving from insights to ideation, and through continuous testing, I was able to develop targeted solutions that streamlined both doctor and patient experiences.</li>
										<li><b>Testing with Real Users is essential</b> Usability testing with real doctors and patients uncovered critical friction points that weren’t obvious during design. These insights led to key design iterations—like simplified form structures and better follow-up management—that improved usability, efficiency, and satisfaction for both user groups.</li>
