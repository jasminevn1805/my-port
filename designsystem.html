									<h1>Research</h1>
									<h3>What A Strong Design System looks like</h3>
									<p>This is the first question I ask myself when starting to build a design system: How do I create something that’s truly effective? I’ve learned that a strong design system is not merely a collection of design elements—it’s a strategic asset that drives efficiency, fosters collaboration, and ultimately results in better products and user experiences.</p>

									<p>To find a methodology for crafting effective interface design systems, I explored various sources of inspiration. From academic insights, such as those from NNG and Interaction Design, to real-life practical design files like M3 Design and Polaris, I found a wealth of knowledge. Additionally, I turned to numerous YouTube videos and podcasts from experienced designers. Through all of this, I discovered Atomic Design, which provided the answer to the question I had been searching for.</p>

									<h3>Atomic Design</h5>
									
										<p>Following <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">bradfrost.com</a>, the design system building based on Atomic Design follows the theory: <b>atomic elements combine together to form molecules, these molecules can combine further to form relatively complex organisms</b>.<br><br> Five distinct stages of Atomic Design:</p>
									<ul class="alt">	
										<li><b>Atoms</b> - Atoms are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.</li>
										<li><b>Molecules</b> - Molecules are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components.</li>
										<li><b>Organisms</b> - Organisms are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.</li>
										<li><b>Templates</b> - Templates place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.</li>
										<li><b>Pages</b> - Pages apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.</li>
									</ul>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/atomic-design-tokens.png" alt="atomic-design-tokens" />
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - Atomic Design Tokens</figcaption>
									</span>
									<br><br>

									<p>I believe this approach is essential for building an effective design system. Establishing a strong foundation ensures a well-structured system, which ultimately provides significant benefits and supports long-term success.</p>

									<!-- Design Principles
									<h3><a href="#" class="icon fas fa-angle-double-right"><span class="label">Outcome</span></a>     Design Principles</h3>
									<p>A strong foundation is essential for a design system that both supports brand customization and promotes team collaboration. Key foundational principles include:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">

												<h5>Simplicity and Clarity</h5>
												<p>Centralized Repository (I used Figma), Maintain a clean, clutter-free Minimalist Design, and Organizing logically, intuitively  Component Hierarchy so it's easy to navigate, and reduce cognitive load for users.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<div class="box">
												<h5>Consistency</h5>
												<p>Maintains a cohesive visual style, including typography, color schemes, and iconography, across all pages and applications to reinforce brand identity.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<div class="box">
												<h5>Efficiency</h5>
												<p>Helps users complete tasks quickly and efficiently, saving time and effort.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
									</div>  -->
									

									<!-- Goals 
									<h3><a href="#" class="icon fas fa-angle-double-right"><span class="label">Outcome</span></a>     Goals</h3>
									<p>Building a design system that meets the following criteias:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Maintainability</b> Easy to update and adapt as the platform evolves.</li>
										<li><b>Reusability</b> Components should be flexible and applicable across different parts of the platform.</li>
										<li><b>Consistency</b> Ensures design uniformity across the product for a seamless user experience.</li>
										<li><b>Scalability</b> Capable of accommodating new features and growing with the platform.</li>
									</ul>   -->

									<!-- Solution -->
									<h1>Working process</h1>

									<!-- Create Atoms - Design Tokens -->
									<h2>Pt.1 | Create Atoms - Design Tokens + Building Blocks</h2>
									<!-- <p>Ref Link: <a href="https://atlassian.design/tokens/design-tokens">Tokens</a> and <a href="https://atlassian.design/components/tokens/all-tokens">Components</a> from Atlassian </p> -->
									<p>Design tokens are the single source of truth for design decisions. These tokens form the foundation of more complex components and can be adapted to ensure consistency across the designs.<br><br><b>#1 - Create Design Tokens categories</b></p>
									
									<ul class="alt">
										<li><b>Color</b> - Define a color palette as design base (Primitive), and create Semantic mappings for specific contexts.</li>
										<li><b>Typography</b> - Define font-related properties like font family, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing as tokens.</li>
										<li><b>Spacing</b> - Define consistent spacing values for padding, margins, and gaps.</li>
										<li><b>Breakpoints</b> - Define breakpoints for different screen sizes that help maintain consistency across various screen sizes.</li>
										<li><b>Radii</b> - Define border-radius values for rounded corners.</li>
										<li><b>Shadow</b> - Define consistent shadow values for elevation and depth.</li>
									</ul>
										
									<p>Also,  <b>ensure the design system is adaptable to different themes, such as light or dark modes</b>, without needing to rebuild components from scratch.</p>

										<b>#2 - Assign semantic names to design tokens</b> to create a system that is easier to understand and work with. This abstraction layer simplifies maintenance, allowing me to update a token’s value in one place, ensuring that the change is automatically applied across all my designs.

									<p>
										<b>#3 - Create Building Blocks</b>, the fundamental UI elements that form the foundation of the design system. These components are crafted to be simple, reusable, and highly flexible, allowing me to seamlessly combine them into more complex components later such as molecules, organisms, and pages.</p>
										<p>Below is an example of the smallest atom I created for a card component, called <b>SLOTS—placeholders for dynamic content within the card</b>.</p>
									<p>Using card slots in product design enables flexible content placement without modifying the underlying structure. To ensure adaptability across different scenarios and meet various aesthetic needs, I design these slots in multiple types and styles. Once established, utilizing a slot becomes simple—I can easily select the desired option from the panel, which contains all predefined attributes.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/card-slot-atom.png" alt="" />
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - Create Card Slots</figcaption>
									</span>

									<!-- Create Component Libraries -->
									<h2>Pt.2 | Create Molecules - Component Library</h2>
									<p>While researching, I learned that creating a molecule-level component library following the Atomic Design principle, requires careful planning and execution to ensure the components are reusable, consistent, and scalable. Here are some key factors I focused on:</p>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Reusablility</h4><p>Molecules should be <b>flexible</b> enough to work in different contexts</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Use components for Atoms when building molecules.</li>
												<li>Design molecules with a clear structure that can handle multi-purpose or variants.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Consistency</h4><p>Molecules should be <b>predictable and uniform structure</b> across the design system</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Molecules use shared design tokens such as colors, typography, spacing, and effects.</li>
												<li>Ensures that all instances of the molecule look and function similarly, maintaining a cohesive design.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Flexibility</h4><p>Molecules should be <b>adaptable</b> to different contexts and content variations</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The molecule accommodates varying content types to fit multiple scenarios.</li>
												<li>The molecule includes optional elements that can be included or excluded as needed.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Code-compatibility</h4><p>Molecules should <b>align closely with development requirements</b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Molecules should follow a standardized naming convention to avoid confusion for devs.</li>
												<li>In term of elements structure and hierarchy, design components should closely mimic the way they will be implemented in code.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>

									

									<p>Continuing with the Card component example, here's how I leverage atom components to create multiple variations of the card design.</p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/molecule-carddesign-step1.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Fig.1 - Step 1 - Design an Article Card from Atom components, then apply Design Tokens</figcaption></span>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/molecule-carddesign-step4.png" alt="" />
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - Step 4 - Adjust hierarchy and name convention</figcaption>
									</span>
									<br><br>


									<!-- Create Modular and Flexible DS -->
									<h2>Pt.3 | Create Organisms - Modules</h2>
									<p>After completing Atoms and Molecules, my next step is creating Organisms by combining Molecules and Atoms altogether. There are several questions I need to answer in order to create an effective module, regarding:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Purpose of Each Organism</h4><p>What is its primary function? Where is it used in the project? to ensure clear functionality. Each Organism should have a specific role within the UI.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Component Structure</h4><p>What are its key components? Less is more, so Reusability is key here. It needs to use the existing Atoms and Molecules rather than creating new components, and must ensure everything remains consistent, and scalable.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4 id="content">Flexible and Modular Organisms</h4><p>Does it have multiple states or variations? in order to adapt to different usecases, or/and, different screen sizes to meet the responsive behavior.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

									<p>Below is the Feature Cards design created by the Atoms and Molecules in the previous steps.</p>
									
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/organisms-carddesign.png" alt="" />
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - Feature Cards were created by reusing Module Content and Card molecules, incorporating properties and nested instances to ensure they are ready for seamless use in the final design.</figcaption>
									</span>
									<br><br>
									<p>As seen above, the <b>Feature module</b> is composed of multiple <b>molecules</b>, such as the <b>Header</b> and <b>Cards</b>. The <b>Card</b> itself is further broken down into smaller parts, including the <b>Background, Image, and Content,</b> with the <b>Content</b> containing elements like <b>Module Content Text</b> and <b>Author</b>. Each modular component is designed with essential <b>properties and variables,</b> ensuring <b>optimization and flexibility</b>. Once this process is complete, the module becomes highly adaptable, allowing it to be reused across various scenarios effortlessly.</p>
									<br><br>

									<!-- Create Component Libraries -->
									<h2>Pt.4 | Create Templates</h2>
									<p>Templates are <b>page-level objects</b> that <b>place modules into a layout</b> and articulate the design's underlying content structure. When incorporating Modules into a Template, the goal is to maintain consistency, scalability, and flexibility while ensuring the layout is both functional and visulaly cohesive.</p>
									<p>To build on our previous example, we can take the card organism and apply it to a homepage template.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/template-withcard.png" alt="" />
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - The onboarding flow dynamically adjusted based on the user’s choice, offering tailored questions and information for each case.</figcaption>
									</span>
									<br><br>
									<p>Each section on the template is designed for dynamic updates. While the underlying templates remain the same, the user interface adapts to reflect the evolving nature of the content. This flexibility ensures that a single template can serve multiple purposes without compromising consistency.</p>
									<p>Additionally, the template design was efficiently created for both desktop and mobile versions, including Android and iOS. This was made possible by the initial setup of variables, allowing seamless adaptation across different screens and operating systems.</p>
									<br><br>
									
									<!-- Create Version Control and Release Management -->
									<h2>Pt.5 - Create Page</h2>
									<p>Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.</p>
									<p>Building on my previous example, I can take the template and pour representative text, images, and media into the template to show real content in action. When I pour real representative content into homepage template, I'm able to see how all those underlying design patterns hold up.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/page-withcard.png" alt="" />
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - The Page is designed for desktop and mobile using pre-setup variations and atomic components.</figcaption>
									</span>
									

									<!-- Results -->
									<h1>Results</h1>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Improved Consistency Across the Product</b><br>By breaking down UI elements into atoms, molecules, and organisms, the design system ensures:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li>A unified visual language across different pages and features.</li>
												<li>Fewer inconsistencies in spacing, typography, and color usage.</li>
												<li>A single source of truth, reducing discrepancies between design and development.</li>
											</ul></li>
										<li><b>Increased Design and Development Efficiency</b><br><br>
											<ul>
												<li>Designers can quickly assemble new screens using pre-built components.</li>
												<li>Developers have reusable code components, reducing repetitive work.</li>
												<li>Faster prototyping and quicker iterations when testing new features.</li>
											</ul></li>
									</ul>


									<!-- Takeaways -->
									<h1>Takeaways</h1>
									<p>A well-designed system is like constructing a well-engineered building: the foundation supports the weight, the structure defines the form, and the finishing touches bring it to life. Each part must be precise, integrated, and built for efficiency. By applying atomic design, I’ve created a foundation that ensures consistency, scalability, and seamless collaboration. A strong design system isn’t just a collection of components; it’s a source of truth that empowers teams, accelerates development, and enhances the user experience. True success lies not only in how it looks but in how effortlessly it enables teams to create, iterate, and innovate.</p>
